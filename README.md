AURA's 2021 Mission Repository: Marco Polo

The 2021 Mission for AURA involves designing and creating a payload (POLO) which can autonomously detect which numbered grid box it has landed in on a predefined grid superimposed on the landing field. It will do this by measuring the strength of sound and radio signals sent from the ground station (MARCO) to determine the angle between the MARCO and POLO, relative to north. Using the known constants for the speed of sound and radio waves, it will then calculate the distance between MARCO and POLO using the difference in time that the two signals are recieved. Finally, it will use this to determine its location and transmit this information back to the ground station.
