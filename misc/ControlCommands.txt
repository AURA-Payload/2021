This document describes the packets of the MARCO-EASE-SOAR-POLO system

----- PACKET DESCRIPTION -----
One packet is transmitted by each system. When a system receives a packet, it will check the system address to determine what parts of the packet are relevant.
Parts of this packet mean different things when sent from different systems.
For example, MARCO sending a 1 for byte1, bit0 indicates that the system should arm.
SOAR sending a 1 for byte1, bit0 indicates that the system is currently armed.

Byte 0 - System address (0 = MARCO, 1 = EASE, 2 = SOAR, 3 = POLO)

Byte 1 - Binary statuses
  Bit 0 - Armed/disarmed
  Bit 1 - EASE dir
  Bit 2 - SOAR dir
  Bit 3 - SLS dir
  Bit 4 - LEGS dir
  Bit 5 - Sundial calibrate (active = 1)
  Bit 6 - Calibrate sun (0) or shade (1)
  Bit 7 - Initiate range/direction find
  
Byte 2 - EASE speed

Byte 3 - SOAR speed

Byte 4 - SLS speed

Byte 5 - LEGS 1 speed

Byte 6 - LEGS 2 speed - NOT USED, LEGS SPEEDS WILL ALWAYS BE THE SAME

Byte 7 - Launch/Landing detection (launch = 1, landing = 2)

----- COMMUNICATION TIMING DESCRIPTION -----
MARCO sends packets every second + whenever a serial command is received
MARCO will not send a command for 5ms after transmitting - this allows SOAR and EASE to transmit
SOAR sends a packet 2ms after receiving a packet from MARCO
EASE sends a packet 2ms after receiving a packet from SOAR

Once POLO sends the packet for range/direction find, the control scheme changes to something else

----- PC COMMUNICATION DESCRIPTION -----
"motorArm" + "on" or "off" -> this activates motor control
"payloadArm" + "on" or "off" -> this activates autonomous operation
"calibrate" + "sun" or "shade" -> this calibrates the sundial
"ease" + "up" or "down" or "off"
"soar" + "up" or "down" or "off"
"sls" + "up" or "down" or "off"
"legs" + "up" or "down" or "off"
