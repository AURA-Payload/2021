This document describes the packets of the MARCO-EASE-SOAR-POLO system

----- PACKET DESCRIPTION -----
One packet is transmitted by each system. When a system receives a packet, it will check the system address to determine what parts of the packet are relevant.
Parts of this packet mean different things when sent from different systems.
For example, MARCO sending a 1 for byte1, bit0 indicates that the system should arm.
SOAR sending a 1 for byte1, bit0 indicates that the system is currently armed.

Byte 0 - System address (0 = MARCO, 1 = EASE, 2 = SOAR, 3 = POLO)

Byte 1 - Binary statuses
  Bit 0 - Armed/disarmed
  Bit 1 - EASE dir
  Bit 2 - SLS dir
  Bit 3 - SLS latch (open/close)
  Bit 4 - LEGS state (retracted/SOAR controlled)
  Bit 5 - POLO levelling (fixed servo/accelerometer controlled)
  Bit 6 - Direction find (in)active
  Bit 7 - Rangefind (in)active
  
Byte 2 - EASE speed

Byte 3 - SLS speed

Byte 4 - Leg 1 angle

Byte 5 - Leg 2 angle

Byte 6 - Leg 3 angle

Byte 7 - Leg 4 angle
