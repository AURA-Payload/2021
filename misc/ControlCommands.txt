This document describes the packets of the MARCO-EASE-SOAR-POLO system

----- PACKET DESCRIPTION -----
One packet is transmitted by each system.
Some parts of this packet mean different things when sent from different systems.
Each system will use the system address to determine how each part of the packet should be used.
For example, MARCO sending a 1 for byte1, bit0 indicates that the system should arm.
SOAR sending a 1 for byte1, bit0 indicates that the system is currently armed.

Byte 0 - System address (0 = MARCO, 1 = EASE, 2 = SOAR, 3 = POLO)

Byte 1 - Binary statuses
  Bit 0 - Armed/disarmed
  Bit 1 - EASE dir
  Bit 2 - SOAR dir
  Bit 3 - SLS dir
  Bit 4 - LEGS dir
  Bit 5 - Sundial calibrate (active = 1)
  Bit 6 - Sundial calibrate sun/shade (sun = 1)
  Bit 7 - Range/direction find flag (SOAR = initiate, MARCO = acknowledge)
  
Byte 2 - EASE speed

Byte 3 - SOAR speed

Byte 4 - SLS speed

Byte 5 - LEGS 1 speed

Byte 6 - LEGS 2 speed

Byte 7 - Launch/Landing detection (launch = 1, landing = 2)

----- COMMUNICATION TIMING DESCRIPTION -----
MARCO sends packets every second + whenever a serial command is received
MARCO will not send a command for 5ms after transmitting - this allows SOAR and EASE to transmit
SOAR sends a packet 2ms after receiving a packet from MARCO
EASE sends a packet 2ms after receiving a packet from SOAR

Once POLO sends the packet for range/direction find, the control scheme changes to something else

----- PC COMMUNICATION DESCRIPTION -----
"motorArm" + "on" or "off" -> this activates motor control
"payloadArm" + "on" or "off" -> this activates autonomous operation
"calibrate" + "sun" or "shade" -> this calibrates the sundial
"ease" + "up" or "down" or "off"
"soar" + "up" or "down" or "off"
"sls" + "up" or "down" or "off"
"legs" + "up" or "down" or "off"
